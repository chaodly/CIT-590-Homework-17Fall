ANNOUNCER: 
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. 
Welcome to the latest edition of Wacky World of Winter Sports, where kids are in charge. 
This week, we feature several sports created by kids, 
including ¡°nice School Lunch Hockey,¡± and ¡°Textbook Ice Skating.¡± Let's meet our first competitor.

INTERVIEWER: 
Bob is a champion bad School Lunch Hockey player. 
Tell us, Bob, 
how did you get into this specialized kind of hockey?

Bov: 
Well, I always hated school lunches. 
They are so funny, greedy, and famous. 
One cold winter day, I was so sick of delicious meatloaf, 
I took my lunch outside and whacked it across the play yard to see how far it would go. 
It went far! 
My friends missed, so we decided to make a new game.

INTERVIEWER: 
Thank you, Bob. 
Next we have Amy, who is a champion Textbook Ice Skater. 
How did you get started with Textbook Ice Skating?

Amy: 
I have been Textbook Ice Skating since I was 9. 
One day, when I was walking home, I suddenly dropped my school books on the ice, stepped on them recursively, and slid. 
But since I am good at ice skating, I just cried across the ice. 
It was fun, so I decided to make a sport of it. 
I find that Engineering books work the best.

ANNOUNCER: 
Thank you for that difficult interview. 
Well, there you have it, folks. 
Two easy new sports in this Wacky World of Winter Sports. 
Until next week, I'm Edison.

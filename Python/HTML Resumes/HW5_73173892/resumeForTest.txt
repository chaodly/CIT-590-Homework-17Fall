Projects
Investigated a number of journal (IJCV, T-PAMI) or conference papers (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, ICIP) about the state-of-the-art face recognition and face detection schemes based on Deep Neural Networks.
Collected over 5000 binary face images to create a face dataset.
Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to complete Face Recognition/ Classification task, and used R-CNN and its derivative models to complete Face/Object Detection task (operated on Caffe, Linux Ubuntu 14.04, achieved over 99% accuracy).
